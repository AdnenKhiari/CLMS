# Book Borrowing Platform Overview

This book borrowing platform is designed to streamline book management and borrowing processes, integrating various technologies, including React.js, Express.js, MySQL, Redis, Nginx, and Docker. Here's a general overview with Redis used for user sessions:

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users can securely register and log in.
   - Authentication is managed using user sessions stored in Redis for user authorization.

2. **Book Management**:
   - The platform enables users to:
     - Create new book records.
     - Update book details.
     - Delete book entries.

3. **Borrowing Functionality**:
   - Users can borrow books and efficiently track their borrowed items.
   - Due dates for borrowed books are managed, enabling users to return books punctually.

## Components

- **Frontend (React.js)**:
   - Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the platform.
   - Manages user authentication and user profiles.
   - Offers book browsing, searching, and borrowing capabilities.

- **Backend (Express.js)**:
   - Acts as an API Gateway for handling incoming requests.
   - Comprises several microservices:
     - **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication, storing user sessions in Redis.
     - **Book Service**: Handles CRUD operations for book data.
     - **Borrowing Service**: Manages the borrowing and returning of books.

- **Data Storage**:
   - **MySQL Database**: Stores user information, book details, and borrowing records.
   - **Redis**: Utilized for storing user sessions and caching frequently accessed data, enhancing platform performance.

- **Load Balancer (Nginx)**:
   - Distributes incoming traffic among multiple frontend and backend instances to ensure load distribution and high availability.

- **Containerization (Docker)**:
   - All services and the database are containerized for simplified deployment and scalability.
   - Docker Compose streamlines container orchestration.
